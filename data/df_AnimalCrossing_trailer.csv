But right now the only one I am left with is the 2008 wii version. I really wanted to get a better version of it but I am a student who has a hard life in my country. Today I was looking at tiktok and I found out that there was a mobile version for animal crossing!!!!!!! I have never been so excited about a game before. But unfortunatley Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp is not available on my region. I got reallll sad. Can you tell me when will it come? I am looking forward to playing it.
