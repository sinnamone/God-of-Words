4,This game feels plasticky if that makes sense.,COD: Black Ops Cold War,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ic4Bi3wxlec,Gameplay
5,my god it looks like this game was released like 3 years ago.,COD: Black Ops Cold War,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ic4Bi3wxlec,Gameplay
6,"I'm not going to lie, I'm not really impressed with what I see so far. Of course, I'll wait and see when the full game releases, but I already see a clear step backwards in regards to animations, sounds etc. 

It just seems to me that if you put this and MW side by side and asked someone which was the ""newer"" looking one, the majority would likely choose MW.",COD: Black Ops Cold War,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ic4Bi3wxlec,Gameplay
7,You can tell this game was seriously rushed... Call of duty needs to hold back from launching a new game every year from now on,COD: Black Ops Cold War,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ic4Bi3wxlec,Gameplay
8,"I'll save my judgement until release, but damn this is not a good first impression at all...",COD: Black Ops Cold War,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ic4Bi3wxlec,Gameplay

11,was feeling ok about it until someone compared it to cod mobile. can't unsee,COD: Black Ops Cold War,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ic4Bi3wxlec,Gameplay
12,"wtf happened, looks like one of those free to play shooters on steam",COD: Black Ops Cold War,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ic4Bi3wxlec,Gameplay
13,This looks like a game we don't need right now.,COD: Black Ops Cold War,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ic4Bi3wxlec,Gameplay
14,I‚Äôll stick with MW. This doesn‚Äôt look good at all imo,COD: Black Ops Cold War,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ic4Bi3wxlec,Gameplay
15,"That‚Äôs how you know a game has a too repetitive model, even the fans want less releases",COD: Black Ops Cold War,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ic4Bi3wxlec,Gameplay
16,Not interested  not even 1% . Looks like the same bs that made me leave  COD for 3 years,COD: Black Ops Cold War,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ic4Bi3wxlec,Gameplay
17,If this wasn‚Äôt called ‚ÄúCold War‚Äù I would actually have no idea what I was looking at,COD: Black Ops Cold War,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ic4Bi3wxlec,Gameplay
18,"Wow, what a step down from Modern Warfare in every way. I was hoping with a real world Cold War setting it would be more grounded, but nope, guess not. I'll be passing on this.",COD: Black Ops Cold War,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ic4Bi3wxlec,Gameplay
19,"The voice acting is spot on. Love the accents.
I do miss native languages to the characters. Even tho you don't understand what they're shouting. But it's so immersive. Like imagine if Nikto actually spoke real russian, instead of that horrible english accent. Instead of ""throwing grenade"", it'd be ""GRANATAA"", like it used to be when you were playing on Spetsnaz side.",COD: Black Ops Cold War,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ic4Bi3wxlec,Gameplay
20,This looks like an upscaled mobile game. Sticking to MW for sure.,COD: Black Ops Cold War,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ic4Bi3wxlec,Gameplay
21,"Yep, definitely a hardline moment in CoD's history, looks bright and shiny, but shit gunshots fx/sounds and completely garbage animations (in several cases not even possible with how the guns actually function in reality) and absolutely no attention to detail makes this a bargain bin imitation of MW2019's success. Fail Treyarch.",COD: Black Ops Cold War,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ic4Bi3wxlec,Gameplay
22,Looks like COD took a huge step forward with Modern Warfare and then a gigantic jump back with Cold War.. not impressed.,COD: Black Ops Cold War,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ic4Bi3wxlec,Gameplay
23,The weapon sounds do not sound good. MW nailed weapon sounds. beating battlefield even. Sucks they cheaped out on sound design on this one. If anyone has shot a real Ak they'll know this sounds horrible.,COD: Black Ops Cold War,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ic4Bi3wxlec,Gameplay
24,Lol this looks like a re-skin of Roblox phantom forces,COD: Black Ops Cold War,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ic4Bi3wxlec,Gameplay
25,Getting some Battlefield Hardline vibes... Let¬¥s wait till that release.,COD: Black Ops Cold War,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ic4Bi3wxlec,Gameplay
26,The HUD looks like something from a cheap game you buy on Steam or something...or a free game you get on the Microsoft StoreüòÖ,COD: Black Ops Cold War,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ic4Bi3wxlec,Gameplay
27,I saw someone say that if the name wasn‚Äôt ‚ÄúCold War‚Äù they wouldn‚Äôt know what they where looking at. I agree this does not look like it takes place in the 80‚Äôs,COD: Black Ops Cold War,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ic4Bi3wxlec,Gameplay
28,This looks like a worse version of MW had no Cold War feel at all it looks like a modern setting if anything,COD: Black Ops Cold War,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ic4Bi3wxlec,Gameplay
29,MW will have more players than this guaranteed. Cold war looks like a mobile game. Total trash.,COD: Black Ops Cold War,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ic4Bi3wxlec,Gameplay
30,"Tbh I'm tempted to buy infinite warfare instead of the new cod (honestly it will be more fun) it looks like treyarch has taken a step back I'd rather have a quality game than a rushed clunky feeling game.
It feels that video games have hit there peak and aren't going anywhere soon this is why people aren't really get a good amount of satisfaction out of a new cod every year. Doubt anyone will read this but if you do please tell me I'm not the only person that feels like this.",COD: Black Ops Cold War,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ic4Bi3wxlec,Gameplay

36,the setting certainly doesn't look cold war-ish. looks more like a 2000s setting.,COD: Black Ops Cold War,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ic4Bi3wxlec,Gameplay
37,I am not that guy who hates on every new game but this doesn‚Äôt have the ‚ÄúCOLD WAR‚Äù feel. The MW2019 had that iraq feel to it.,COD: Black Ops Cold War,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ic4Bi3wxlec,Gameplay
38,"This feels like a re skinned bo4 especially with some of the legacy animations, not impressed.",COD: Black Ops Cold War,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ic4Bi3wxlec,Gameplay

42,Thats what's happening when you buy MW from Wish,COD: Black Ops Cold War,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ic4Bi3wxlec,Gameplay
43,"Amazing, how the critically acclaimed realism and progressive vision of the previous modern warfare has been utterly forgotten and tossed, in the development of this piss shoot.",COD: Black Ops Cold War,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ic4Bi3wxlec,Gameplay
44,when the community having fun trying the new mechanic from mw then suddenly treyach didnt wanna continue it....what a let down honestly,COD: Black Ops Cold War,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ic4Bi3wxlec,Gameplay

50,this is just a modern combat game they‚Äôre pretending is in the cold war lol,COD: Black Ops Cold War,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ic4Bi3wxlec,Gameplay
51,This is the most try hard battlefield clone I think I've seen.,COD: Black Ops Cold War,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ic4Bi3wxlec,Gameplay
52,Looks like free to play Chinese ripoff of COD.,COD: Black Ops Cold War,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ic4Bi3wxlec,Gameplay
53,I'm only buying this for the zombies bc the multiplayer seems worthless compared to mw,COD: Black Ops Cold War,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ic4Bi3wxlec,Gameplay
54,I think this game began production earlier this year.,COD: Black Ops Cold War,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ic4Bi3wxlec,Gameplay

70,That desert map reminds me of a mix of tatooine and the one desert map in BF1 lmao,COD: Black Ops Cold War,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ic4Bi3wxlec,Gameplay
71,Is it just me or does 2019s CoD MW still look better and play better than this?!ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,COD: Black Ops Cold War,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ic4Bi3wxlec,Gameplay
72,"This looks like a step backwards tbh. I understand it's pre-release, and the treyarch vibe is more arcade-like, but if you told me 1.5 years ago this was the new CoD after BO4, I wouldn't bat an eye. I'd say, ""uh ok. and?"" and continue to not buy or even think about CoD games. MW created its own hype and felt like a quantum leap. This feels like an offshoot build of CoD mobile or something.",COD: Black Ops Cold War,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ic4Bi3wxlec,Gameplay
73,Why does all the dead animation looks like someone hit them on the nuts.,COD: Black Ops Cold War,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ic4Bi3wxlec,Gameplay

87,The guns sounds like a typewriter,COD: Black Ops Cold War,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ic4Bi3wxlec,Gameplay
88,Honestly I thought that vip game mode looked sick ! Love the idea of not having rigid bomb sites like in snd and having a important player to protect,COD: Black Ops Cold War,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ic4Bi3wxlec,Gameplay
89,The pregame lobby looks like a mobile gameüòÇ,COD: Black Ops Cold War,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ic4Bi3wxlec,Gameplay
90,"I wish you could actually customize your character and put certain gear on that you like , not just pre set operators that you can‚Äôt customize",COD: Black Ops Cold War,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ic4Bi3wxlec,Gameplay

93,maps look way too big and something about the game feels clunky. Hopefully things are better when the game comes out.,COD: Black Ops Cold War,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ic4Bi3wxlec,Gameplay
94,Map is perfect size!!! Love that it's not fast pace. It's MORE tactical that MW. Pre ordering!!! I'm more of a fan of it that you. Man I wish I had this access. Looks amazing!!!!,COD: Black Ops Cold War,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ic4Bi3wxlec,Gameplay

98,When that second game started... the one at the night map... I thought I was watching Battlefield Hardline gameplay... no CoD for me this year...,COD: Black Ops Cold War,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ic4Bi3wxlec,Gameplay
99,That trigger discipline at the start of the video told everything I need to know about this game. lol,COD: Black Ops Cold War,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ic4Bi3wxlec,Gameplay
100,"Nothing makes me more happy than hearing you say no mounting in this game, i would have damascus easily in modern warfare but i just despise doing mounted kills so just dont even want to fully go for it",COD: Black Ops Cold War,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ic4Bi3wxlec,Gameplay

Will we be able to use Soviet-style operators, skins etc? Cos I have a feeling from what I've seen that everything is going to be American",COD: Black Ops Cold War,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ic4Bi3wxlec,Gameplay
102,This reminds me of the mobile version of call of duty,COD: Black Ops Cold War,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ic4Bi3wxlec,Gameplay
103,Honestly I regret preordering the game just looks and sounds years before it's time they need to start thinking like bf and talking time on there games not just producing one every year,COD: Black Ops Cold War,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ic4Bi3wxlec,Gameplay
104,After watching other Youtubers play this I'm excited for it. I had mixed feelings at first because it isn't as pretty as MW 2019 but it's going back to the faster paced Lane system which already makes the gameplay LOADS better than MW 2019. I will miss the looks and animations of MW 2019 though.,COD: Black Ops Cold War,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ic4Bi3wxlec,Gameplay
105,This is a downgrade from MW 2019 and looks literally like 6 or so other cod games. Back to guns that are all the same and feel and sound like pea shooters...,COD: Black Ops Cold War,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ic4Bi3wxlec,Gameplay
106,Maps look fun. That's about it.,COD: Black Ops Cold War,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ic4Bi3wxlec,Gameplay
107,Jack sounded so disappointed the whole time,COD: Black Ops Cold War,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ic4Bi3wxlec,Gameplay

109,"I know this game is gonna be hard to get used to after MW, because at 35:32 I was fully expecting him to charge through that closed door even though he‚Äôd already made it clear that there are no longer dynamic doors.",COD: Black Ops Cold War,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ic4Bi3wxlec,Gameplay
110,But imagine Cold War on the MW engine,COD: Black Ops Cold War,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ic4Bi3wxlec,Gameplay
111,"It doesn't seem as fun as MW...gameplay, the HUD, etc. I just can't see myself enjoying this game. I was so excited when I heard it was a game set right after BO1 but now I'm not sure I want it. 
It's kind of a let down after MW‚òπÔ∏è",COD: Black Ops Cold War,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ic4Bi3wxlec,Gameplay
112,Nothing in this game looks better than MW. Definitely a setback from Modern Warfare. There‚Äôs just nothing unique or special.,COD: Black Ops Cold War,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ic4Bi3wxlec,Gameplay
113,Modernwarfare is a timeless game that I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre gunna top for a long time. Just like how MW2 was,COD: Black Ops Cold War,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ic4Bi3wxlec,Gameplay

115,Mp-7's reloading animation is just unfinished!,COD: Black Ops Cold War,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ic4Bi3wxlec,Gameplay

117,not gonna lie this looks like a watered down Battlefield Hardline.,COD: Black Ops Cold War,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ic4Bi3wxlec,Gameplay
118,This game gives me the nfs effect where Modern Warfare is the Most Wanted 2005 so this game get criticized for not being like MW which is the plan the Devs are doing ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,COD: Black Ops Cold War,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ic4Bi3wxlec,Gameplay
119,What an idiot I am for pre ordering this before seeing gameplay. I expected in 2020 youd think the game would look and feel better but this looks dreadful.,COD: Black Ops Cold War,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ic4Bi3wxlec,Gameplay
120,"Is it me or do the animations look odd, take a look at the stun animation with the hand coming up, it feels clunky and not natural. Also weird reload at 35:28 the magazine floated up by itself. MW animations are so much more natural the intro cutscenes also don't flow well into gameplay. The mix of cold war with a minimalist/futuristic twist also doesn't seem like a good choice having neon waves around objectives is just an odd choice, as if a dev just said ""that looks cool"". Style doesn't look consistent. Pretty disappointing",COD: Black Ops Cold War,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ic4Bi3wxlec,Gameplay
121,Yeah I'll wait for a new Battelfield and stick with MW this just looks disappointing. If Battlefield 3 is remastered or something like that I'll buy that instead of this.,COD: Black Ops Cold War,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ic4Bi3wxlec,Gameplay

125,"This is literally exact opposite to what I expected. I thought it would be gritty, limited hud, low TTK and like little gadgets that help you hack shit. Instead we get some cartoon shit that feels like it was made before BO4....",COD: Black Ops Cold War,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ic4Bi3wxlec,Gameplay
126,I'm glad I watched this as a video rather than live streamed as I could just jump over all the delays in game play.,COD: Black Ops Cold War,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ic4Bi3wxlec,Gameplay

Sure, the gun behavior is a big impact on how an FPS feels, but CoD always acted more of a way to get friends together and goof off rather than focusing on how accurate it is to real life.

Movement is sluggish.. The chopper looks like Bo1 chopper, like a toy in the air, movement looks unrealistic.                      Just my opinion., personally I think cod needs to just do what battlefield does.. Attachments is just for looks to customize your weapons as u like. U can equip any attachment..  But doesn't make your weapons overpowered..  That way ppl use different weapon and not be like warzone/modern warfare where everyone is using the same weapon because ppl find out what weapons they buffed or are broken based on the attachments.    Mw2 ppl would run their weapon of choice and win.. With tactical pistol, or only knifes.. Shotgun..
