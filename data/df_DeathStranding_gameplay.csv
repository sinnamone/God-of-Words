300,"Wait, I think I‚Äôve got it! The beach or shore is where souls go when they die right? When Sam died, that‚Äôs where his soul was when it disconnected from his body. So if someone dies they need to burn their bodies to free their souls basically so they can go into the shore otherwise they have this reaction around 48 hours after death that causes them to transform and become a BT (Beached Thing). Presumably due to a buildup of that chiralium stuff in the body. I mean if it‚Äôs in the water or the air, EVERYBOdY must have some of it running through them. And when it is released into the air and it builds up into rain clouds it creates time fall which ages and grows everything it touches rapidly. Also the chiralium from the rain seems to attract BTs. Perhaps through its connection to the other side. BTs are probably lost souls who don‚Äôt know what they‚Äôre doing and just wander around trying to make it to the shore I guess. That‚Äôs what I think.",Death Stranding,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_X579M7shYU,Gameplay

Like I get these babies are used for something not normal here.. but still whatever their function was, surely when that function is gone you can just then treat is as a normal baby afterwards?  Humanity can't really recover if you keep killing off the babies..    but maybe the story will explain it down the line.

1571,"My theory: (I'm only 20 minutes in and haven't seen anything else on this. in case I'm close I want bragging rights) A star went supernova, and while in the nuclear fusion process managed to create a new element, that element got sent to Earth via a meteor or something, and when it landed it released a new element into the air, evaporating from its liquid form the precipitating onto the Earth affecting people, contaminating their bodies. The people would die and come back (I have no theory on how that would work, I could probably conjure an idea with radioactive isotopes and half-life, but idk). They found out an effective solution would be, stay out of the rain and burn the dead or contaminated dead, but the element in their body isn't affected in the evaporation process and doesn't turn into ash, so it gets carried into the clouds, restarting the process.",Death Stranding,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_X579M7shYU,Gameplay
