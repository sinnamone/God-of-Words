10,"The people responsible for creating the maps, worlds and all the graphic part of the game in the last three AC titles deserve every award and acclamation they get. The people responsible for the gameplay on the other hand are just a bunch of lazy bums who should all be fired and never allowed to develop videogames again.

18,"That Rikiwulf battle was insanely hard and entertaining.

I find it a bit shocking in 2020 (exemple at 22m40s...even AC black flag in 2013 was far better on that). Although some others bushes do move when passing through, the way those are modelized and moving is so bad (exemple with red flowers at 26m55s). I just got the SeriesX version so I noticed it while playing. Regarding the HUD, you can lessen text size and desactivate it, but there's no in-between (can't manage opacity, or let appear the objective just by tapping a button for instance...) And I find the life bar is too significant visually and the compass indication too long... It hurts immersion.",Assassin's Creed Valhalla,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=my9RahtFyS4,Gameplay
