14,"I just finished my first playthrough of the Witcher 3 and I have to say, it reminded me of why I play video games in the first place. I was fearing that a shift in my life was happening, as i've gotten older my free time has become more sparse and i've been hesitant to give it up to video games because no matter how flashy the graphics or the initial entry point into the created worlds, The glamour and effect of a new game has begun to wear off on me more and more rapidly. When I was younger my brother and I had a couple of shared experiences of playing together cooperatively on games that would takes us a year or more to complete. Through the trials and tribulations we became extremely immersed in the worlds these games created and fully invested in the characters. Finally completing them was a fully emotional experience (this only happened for us with two games. very rare indeed.) For a young kid with a big wide imagination stepping into another realm and exploring and questing was a dream come true and one I committed to very seriously and connected to. As i've grown older, I've been anywhere from casual to avid gamer throughout the past couple of years and though I've become no less willing to chase titles and try new experiences, the novelty of most games wears thin quickly and I have found most experiences mildly disappointing. After semi-bland experience to semi-bland experience I started to think of video games as mild sedatives (short reprieves from the 'real world' used until one becomes bored.) I'd forgotten what a true gaming experience was like, and had begun to fear that perhaps my childhood naivety was what made the experiences magic and not the games themselves (and to a certain degree that is true.) However, the Witcher 3 reminded me of what I had forgotten. It reminded me of why I play video games in the first place. A video game can be art, vast and enthralling and expansive, immersive, witty, fluid, challenging, chilling, and heartbreaking. I dove into the Witcher 3 and not only was it so beautifully crafted and rendered in its' voice acting, combat system, environments, plot and intrigue, but IT TOOK TIME. I have been obsessively playing the game for about a month and a half, relishing every last detail. And when the time came to part ways I, quite unexpectedly, welled up with tears. I waited until the end of the credits to the inevitable switch back to Geralt, and took a long last stroll through the empty ruins of Kaer Morrhen, found a nice rock by a stream in the woods and took a last pan of the environment, watching a flock of birds cross the sky, deer nibble on grass beside the riverbed, and clouds enshroud the tips of far-off mountain peaks. I watched Geralt watch the scene, knowing that I will most likely put this game away for a good long while while I digest it and move forward with my life, and I just soaked in the detail for a good moment before clicking my system off. Unforgettable experience. I will cherish it.",The Witcher 3,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHrskkHf958,Trailer

All this narration in this game just made the best game of 2015 and with Blood & Wine 2016 (B&W won the best RPG price of 2016, yes an expansion).

91,"I just got this on Xbox Game Pass last week. For some reason I never played it despite hearing how much of a masterpiece it is. Nothing could've prepared me for how good this game is and the only experience I can compare it too was when I played The Last of Us for the first time and it emotionally wrecked me. I beat the main quests in 4 days and in a week Ive played over 70 hours of it. The characters, the story, the world, the music. It's all brilliant. I actually find myself missing the characters and feel kind of empty now. I bought and played both DLCs which are the epitome of post launch content. As soon as the credits rolled I went to the xbox marketplace and paid full price to own the game, I felt dirty only playing it free through gamepass and not giving CD Project Red my money. Because holy shit do they ever deserve it. Might be the best game I've ever played. Somehow I'd never seen this trailer when the game came out too and my god does it hit the feels. They tell you the basic plot, get you emotionally invested, have a who's who of a bunch of the characters you'll meet, then hint at the intense climactic moments that are to come all with just visuals and the amazing Ben Howard song (which btw thank you to the marketing team at CD Project Red for choosing this song and getting me into him, his music is fantastic).

653,"THINKING ABOUT SECOND PLAY-TROUGH. Do yourself a favor people and read the books. They are every bit as amazing and epic as this game. You can easily buy them at google books and just read while commuting to work for example. It gives a totally new perspective on the whole Witcher universe. And makes all the characters so much more alive and dear. After reading the books you can make informed decisions on witch mods to install for complete immersion (Geralt for example had no bombs or crossbow and was always strapped for money...etc.). This is truly special very very special game. A game that instantly evokes emotions and precious memories. It is simply an art and a masterpiece at that. Allow yourself to be immersed in game, read everything, don't analyze the mechanics (stop comparing it to skyrim or dark souls)...role play around inconsistencies (or MOD it :)...WALK everywhere . And then you will see for yourself why so many fellow gamers calling it the best game ever made. This game has heart and possion in every detail.

872,"It's a damn shame that tales such as these and with these kinds of settings are underrepresented in popular media, at least in my opinion. Not only these BRILLIANT modern recastings, but their older sources. It upsets me greatly that there is no effort to make something like a film of Beowulf that is accurate and attempts to capture the spirit of the work. Especially because that really would not be hard to do given the budget that some blockbusters have. It's just a damn shame.

I picked the game back up 5 days ago, started fresh, did everything I should've done before and it's now my 4th favourite game of all time. I'm a year and 1 month late, I know.
