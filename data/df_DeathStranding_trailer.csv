293,"“ ‘Death Stranding’ is a completely new type of action game, where the player’s goal is to reconnect isolated cities and a fragmented society. All elements, including the story and gameplay, are bound together by the theme of ‘Strand’, or connection. As Sam Porter Bridges, you will attempt to ‘Bridge’ these divisions, and in doing so, create new bonds or ‘Strands’ with other players around the globe. Through your experience playing the game. I hope you’ll come come to understand the true importance of forging connections with others.” - Hideo Kojima",Death Stranding,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gu8X7vM3Avw,Trailer

330,"Based on what little information is available at this point, I think I have a decent idea of what this game is about. Sometime in the future, the US government somehow managed to open a portal to another reality (or some sort of purgatory), but it's caused nature to go haywire. The air from that reality is toxic, and it's leeched into ours, poisoning the air and rain. The Bridge Babies exist because the poison from the alternate reality has also caused mass infertility, so natural birth and procreation is impossible; the only way to make babies now is with that technology. Monsters from the alternate reality roam this world waiting for a human to kill. The demons seen from the Bridge Baby scan are also from that reality. To access that reality, you have to die and then somehow come back. Using this and all the tools that Bridges has given you, a Bridge Baby all grown up, your mission is to find the rest of civilization and hopefully work together to cut off connection to the alternate reality, ending the apocalypse so that humanity can rebuild.",Death Stranding,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gu8X7vM3Avw,Trailer

The stuff other players do in their game might change the game world for everyone somehow. Exploration seems to be a heavy focus. It won't be a ""survival horror"" game but avoiding enemies seems to be encouraged.

900,"My theory on what the gameplay is going to be about is just like metal gear solid, you have to sneak around enemies, etc. but now you have to avoid killing people because enemy corpses are absorbed by the BT. The player will have to manage different bases and/or side with different factions and play as a courier, delivering packages, hiking, avoiding pirates and running away from anomalies.",Death Stranding,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gu8X7vM3Avw,Trailer
901,"I was originally excited for this game but now I am not sure. I hope it is good.

For any MGS fans it’s important to remember that MGS was more of a labour of duty than one of love, for all of the games except the first. Kojima said multiple times he didn’t want to continue but did it for the fans; this leads me to think often his complete creative freedom was always kept in check as he had to keep everything in bounds with what fans wanted and expected. Some of the overly creative stuff that did go into MGS (read: confusing story) is quite controversial between fans and non-fans.",Death Stranding,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gu8X7vM3Avw,Trailer

There are so many low budget studios that turn their games into a real project of passion and creativity, but it seems like the majority of big publishers view games solely as a means to make absurds amount of money. So many Triple A games now are hyped up just so they can be released as barely a shell of what they were advertised to be. I've always believed Kojima and his team are the kind of developers  that actually want to deliver on what they're promising.

1562,"To everyone in the comment section joking about not understanding anything. It's actually pretty easy. The rectum-lion that the teleporting man with a fetus device summoned in the other trailer is an interdimensional creature who is part of other living organisms in an ultradimensional shift caused by lunar... waves. From colonies on the moon. Because mads mikkelsen lives in the oil now, sam has to save humanity from egyptian gods. And dead-man's vision in world war 2 with tentacle tanks is because of sleep paralysis. So. The eldritch horror with two golden hands as a head holding wires blows up causing a void out, this is because life is uncertain and volatile. Like that rectum-lion Troy Baker made before teleporting. The void creatures are a representation of the fractured sense of self we humans are suffering from social media. Therefore Sam must build bridges, so we don't become mindless skeleton soldiers. We must reconnect with ourselves, because us connecting to social media disconnected our minds from sanity. Like me. Do I look sane here? Woopedie-fucking-doooo hell no! See what Kojima is trying to say? This internett addiction has destroyed our souls. We need to go out in nature again, with ladders.",Death Stranding,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gu8X7vM3Avw,Trailer
