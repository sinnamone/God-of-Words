Therefore, lots of people stopped doing let's play videos (Pewdiepie for example). But you, you didn't ever stop reusing the formula that you built your channel on and you are still by far an excellent and popular youtuber.

384,"Hey man. I'm wanting to start up a gaming channel of my own, similar to yours. I've been playing games, since I was in diapers, crawling. My grandma, God rest her soul, was a gamer, and is the one who got me playing games at such a young age. When I started playing, the regular Nintendo was THE console to play. Then grandma got a Super Nintendo, and I played that. So I've been a gamer for 28 years. If I didn't have video games, I don't know WHAT I would do. What all do I need to start up a channel, like yours? I'm not trying to copy you. You just inspire me to do it. I just want to have commentary on the games I play. No camera recording me. Could really use some help, on what all I need. I should however note, that I'm on a tight budget. So I can't really afford thousands of dollars worth of equipment. I have a PS4. Just not sure on how to capture gameplay, and voice over. Thanks for inspiring me to do it myself brother. I know this is a somewhat older video. RDR2 is my all time favorite game, and I never got to watch you play it when it launched, cause I was too busy playing it myself. I STILL do.
