8,"the more I think about it the more I like the ending. in this subgenre of games, we expect the goal to be keeping everyone alive, so we make every decision based on that. but that's not the objective of little hope, and the game tells you that from the beginning when everyone dies in the house and the curator says you couldn't have saved them. the hints as to what's going on are actually quite heavy-handed. the curator says several times that you're not supposed to be saving everyone, you're supposed to be finding the bus driver and forgiving mary/megan.

22,"Jack, literally the outcome that determines who walks out of the house is solely based on the answers you give during some interactions. That's it. That's what determined Angela walking out of the house and no one else. Because Taylor wasn't a team player,  didn't turn Daniel into a hero at the end (that one you were close to saving him but you needed to choose for him to tell Andrew to let go and run when holding the bar), Angela needed to become more understanding to the group (which you did), and John needed to become an authority figure and not a coward. But there was no way to know that's what you needed to do or the exact correct lines of dialogue you needed to choose in order to get them all to survive. Also, apparently shooting at the ghost with Vince nearby caused this ending.

44,"Something none of the YouTubers I have watched have mentioned is the relationship between Reverend Carson and Megan. According to Reverend Carver's words at the end ""satans whore"", ""I fell under your spell""  and talking about their little ""secret"" I am pretty sure the reverend was molesting Megan. During the 70s the parents fight about have the Reverend keeps making her stay after prayers and how she is misbehaving (a common thing for children going through that to do). Also, I think the devil or monster she was talking to at the beginning was how she sees the reverend in her mind. It's very common for children who are being molested to picture their attacker as a monster, so I think that's what she was doing. Anthony knows he lives in a town where there used to be witch trials and like his brother, Dennis mentions there are some weird cult-like things going on in the town (this is also mentioned in a note at the church I believe) and he also knows that Mary has been asked to stay after church and that she has been misbehaving. We must also not forget that he got a head injury in the house fire. With all of that said I think that's why he conjures up this idea of a witch trial in his head. I don't think it's random at all.",Little Hope,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1XCbkoLijc,Gameplay

Daniel’s is also very well designed, having to move the sticks by hand in order to walk properly. The story was very good, mostly, and the ending was.. ehhhh.. but the designs of the monsters ROCKED. This studio knows how to make freaking amazing creatures. The windigo (and their freaky movement) in Until Dawn, the two-headed skeleton creature in Man of Medan (which I still don’t understand narrative-wise, but design is A+), and these four bad boys and gals are just spectacular.

The reason why the witch trials were linked into it was so that he could explain (to himself) why his sister, Megan burned the house down (she was influenced by her past self or some demon). He does this so that the blame is taken away from his sister because it's not her fault she was targeted, and therefore put all the blame on him for 1: lighting the stove and 2: not being able to save anyone. So, if you save all the characters Andrew gets a sort of mental ""second chance"" in which at the end he can feel satisfied he saved his family in a second life or some bullshit like that.

213,It's about redemption. Their souls get to pass on when Andrew saves them (like Angela here). Otherwise they are trapped until Andrew does. They have to face their own demons alone. My guess would be that Angela was saved because a decision that Jack made put Angela alone in the sewers where she faced her demon. So for John I think the decision would have been to tell the others to go on without him when his demon was pouncing on the door thus showing courage and selflessness and therefore facing his demon.

251,jack! you missed a few very big hints both in the museum and the graveyard. in the museum when you're there with andrew and john you can look at the display case and the doll is in there and you can interact with it. in the graveyard you missed the graves of the 70's family. there are only 5 graves out of six. which is a hint to andrew/anthony surviving the fire. there is also a hint to vince being tanya's boyfriend. because there are flowers on her grave. to save everyone they need to battle their own demons like the curator hints at. also you won't be arrested if you don't shoot at vince by the church. you will get a different ending if you condemn the girl instead! because that will cause a butterfly effect for both the 70's family and the modern group. not wanna spoil if you wanna play again so that's why i'm keeping it kinda vauge! but this was a nice playthrough!,Little Hope,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1XCbkoLijc,Gameplay

There's even some meditating on a full moon, collect moon water, and keeping track on moon phases. So i have a theory that Tanya use a love spell on Vince.

378,"Spoilers:

So I’m sure a lot of people are explaining this, but there are essentially two ways the characters get killed. The first is failing qtes which essentially just gamey and idk what the story explanation is. Ig that the characters don’t get a chance to redeem themselves. But the reason you lost people is because of the dialogue options and character traits they developed through the game. As you saw in the 1970s house fire, they were all POS people, and the whole point of the game is them being able to redeem themselves and anthony/andrew forgiving megan for what she did. If you choose to accuse megan, you fail to forgive her and everyone dies, no matter what. If you forgive megan, which you did, their deaths depends on if they were redeemed or not (hence why you see the negative traits locked in the monsters’ eyes). The only other real choice based thing is whether or not you are nice to vince, in which he’ll forgive you and help you at the end, or if he’ll call the cops. So the characters’ deaths weren’t because of the ending you chose with accusing the priest, but the dialogue and relationship options you made throughout the game. That’s why they died",Little Hope,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1XCbkoLijc,Gameplay

I think the survival of the characters depends on how they redeem themselves over the game by the choices the player makes.

As he says with the 'it's all a dream' type of ending along with cliffhangers with no intention of writing another book are very 'cheap' and very lazy ways to end the writing. You don't have to make it make sense at all because everything can be explained away by its just a dream or its all in his head.

SPOILER/DEEPER EXAMINATION

The reason you feel so deflated by your choices not mattering in the end is because that is literally how 'survivors guilt' works.

592,"I actually really liked the ending.
These are all my thoughts so don't judge me if my logic is flawed lol:

- I feel like the reason why Angela was saved at the end was because of her positive character change; she was the only one that changed and became nicer in a sense (I think we can come to understand that by how Sean came to like her more as we approached the end). The negative character traits that were shown next to the characters before they died are the things that they should have grown out of in this experience but didn't, and so they met their doom. So if you want to replay the game, you shouldn't replay it to change the exact ending because that isn't possible; you should do it to change the characters and their personalities.",Little Hope,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1XCbkoLijc,Gameplay
593,Picking the heroic decisions is the good ending and the game is all about Anthony forgiving himself for what happened and not blaming himself or anyone else and to not blame Mary because she was abused and lashed out because of that so basically choosing the heroic decision is getting over those demons and forgiving himself for the accident and that there was nothing to do about it so basically just the point of the game is Anthony forgiving himself and that he has that feeling that it was not his fault,Little Hope,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1XCbkoLijc,Gameplay

744,"Game Theory: so I have a theory about the true story of this game, bear with me. The true story occurs in the 70s and carries into the present/future. The Witch Trial gameplay was merely symbolism and used for jumpscares and horror elements because the overall undertone of the story, as you find out in the end, is less about demons and monsters and witches and more about mental health and grieving.

I think that maybe the ""good ending"" is that you save everyone from the witch timeline, cause then they would all have a natural death instead and make it so that this ""curse"" ,that forces them to die the same way everytime in all timelines, is lifted, but Idk maybe I'll give the game a try myself and see if my theory is true.",Little Hope,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1XCbkoLijc,Gameplay

773,"Jack, just to clarify it for you: there were a ton of tiny breadcrumbs. For example, the fact that there was a man of Asian descent playing a Puritan Judge. There is also the fact that the name of the bus company changed after the crash. Oh, and the State Trooper? He was also the goon/executioner from the Witch Trials scene, and the ""judge"" was the guy who saw him with the matches at the start of the game. Also at the beginning, when the bus driver (Anthony) gets on the bus, he's reading a book on witchcraft/sorcery. Not only that, but isn't it just a tad strange that all his family members died the EXACT same way in the Puritan times as they did in the bus driver's lifetime? I mean, if it was reincarnation, I'd get it, but Abraham/Andrew never died, so he'd never be reincarnated. Also in the game, there's a map from the Puritan times. On it should've been the names of all the big families who own a bunch of land, like Carver and the ""previous versions"" of his family, but they're not there. Then, there's the new graveyard, where you can find the graves of most of the people who were around during the ""witch trials"", when they should've been buried off in the old graveyard, indicating that there were no witch trials at all. ",Little Hope,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1XCbkoLijc,Gameplay

871,"Really glad I didnt buy this myself, it was gifted to me. much like Men of Medan the ending killed it for me. Like this was so much better in so many ways, but just like Men of Medan the ending makes no impact and has no weight. And it's really sad that the game has multiple endings because that ending, at least for me, thoroughly killed all my replay hype. That's 2 for 2 on disappointing endings for the dark pictures, I dont have hope for the third. Seems like Until Dawn was the only thing they could actually pull off. Will say this though the Curator is the most interesting part of the anthology so far. Which ur series is flawed if the most interesting mystery is the narrating character. ""I meet everyone, once"" I'm not allowed to help, not my place, apparently."" Like what is he, actually death? With these endings, bet hes just a hallucination too dammit.

891,"I feel kind of disappointed by the ending :/ I think it would have been cooler if they had gone with the theme of reincarnation that they had set up. I feel like the game developers have been staying away from having the supernatural stuff be real at the end of the story excluding until dawn, but when the story of the game relies so much on believing in the supernatural its just a let down when you find out everything was fake in the end. The reason why until dawn worked so well is because it took normal horror tropes and then subverted your expectations and dealt with both the supernatural horror of the situation and how the characters reacted to it. I understand that dark pictures is probably trying to show real issues caused by mental illness and psychological trauma, but that doesn't mean that the supernatural stuff has to be fake to take the mental illness stuff seriously. The way it's shoehorned in at the end also just doesn't feel right.",Little Hope,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1XCbkoLijc,Gameplay

913,Yeah the whole megan x the demon thing confused the crap out of me. They show Megan in the 70's with the demon claw next to her like Jack said but then.....literally never mentions it again? If the Reverend was the one behind it then did Megan even have any magical powers back in the 1600's? I feel like she had them in the 70's because her family abused her? Or was the demon symbolic of the 70's Reverend/Priest? I feel like that could be a good explanation for the demon but it's never outright confirmed in the game. And if this is all PTSD that Anthony has like why even come up with this complicated 1600's witch trial story? What on earth does that have to do with Anthony's family other than the fact everyone thought Megan was a creep. I know PTSD can cause a lot of things but that is so......outta left field or whatever the saying is.,Little Hope,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1XCbkoLijc,Gameplay

920,"Alright so I understand how the family from the 70's and the modern bus crash survivors are the same and connected.  It's all explained easily even though I'm not satisfied with it.  However, the witch trials still confuse me.  The museum was real.  They resemble the people in the witch trials that actually historically had evidence in the town of Little Hope.  There's Angela/Amy's picture in the museum.  Are we just ignoring that they all looked exactly alike?  Or are we assuming that Andrew's concussion makes everything up based on the history of the town and him working through his issues?  Was it like the images of his family were just haunting him in every face and life he saw around him?

924,"so, basically the game is anthony learning how to cope with the death of his family, and being unable to save them. he was reading about the witch trials (we see the book in the beginning), and all of his family died in the ways that they killed witches. that, with the town's history helped him attach it to the trials. at first, he seems to blame megan for everyone's death. he saw her as responsible for killing them, but then sees that she was just a child. there's some implications that the reverend was doing bad things to mary, and she saw him as a scary demon. in order for andrew to let go, he has to accept mary is innocent, and has to change the personalities of everyone to have peace with them. if they die early, he will never have peace. he like, needs to see their good sides and accept them as people who shouldn't be condemned.",Little Hope,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1XCbkoLijc,Gameplay

1006,"The witch trial section does have a bearing on the story, it'll be much more evident in the Curator's Cut. The Curator's cut is what made me go from hating the game to loving it. It makes you realize that the ending doesn't ruin the story, it enhances the value of the second playthrough. Megan was being abused by her church's priest in the 70s, and the tried so hard to tell her family, but none of them would give her the time of day. So she made up a figure to speak to that would allow her to vent. The witch trial sections of this game are a representation of a process in Anthony's mind. He's thinking of all the ways that his family members were guilty of neglecting Megan, and how their 'demons' led Megan to act out and destroy the house, killing the family. At the same time, Andrew is sorting through his own grief of being unable to save his family. The first playthrough of this game makes you hate it, but playing again lets you piece it together accurately and experience the reality of what is happening in the story.",Little Hope,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1XCbkoLijc,Gameplay

1136,"It's kinda sad that Jack doesn't see the ending for what it is. I think it was very good. And looking back on the game knowing the twist, lets you see all the little hints. Like the Judge being the asian guy from the beginning, he saw Anthony with the matches, which led to his arrest. So he imagined him as the judge in the trials. Its very subtle and all, and the true or good ending would make it a lot more clearer, but in the end it was the story about a boy who went through hell and faced his own demons. As the curator hinted at. The choices do matter because they matter to Andrew/Anthony. He needed to come to terms with what happened and that it wasn't his fault.

1176,"So I wonder if this trend is going to follow for the other Dark Anthology games. Both this and Man of Medan don't have actual ""horror"" in them the way that Until Dawn did. In Until Dawn you had actual creatures chasing after you. But both of the Dark Anthology games have more physiological horror elements with everything being in the characters heads (or at least the creatures anyways). So I wonder if the third game in Dark Anthology series will have something similar to Little Hope and Man of Medan with there being no ACTUAL creature threat, and there being something else to put the characters in danger. Not that physiological horror is bad or somehow less then actual monsters, just that these games seem to be going a different route then  what Until Dawn took.",Little Hope,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1XCbkoLijc,Gameplay

Because at the start of the game the curator said “To thine own self be true” and I think he was saying you need to be ‘true’ to the characters and not just do what YOU what them to do but what THEY would do in that situation. Because at the start you get given their traits and I think at the end they still need to have those traits hence why they were ‘locked’ because they didn’t have those traits.",Little Hope,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1XCbkoLijc,Gameplay

1294,"Okay so on Man of Medan I was unsure whether the bad story was the writing or just the quality of the actors, and to be fair in that one it may have been both. HOWEVER, I am 1 hour into this playthrough and I can say with absolute certainty that the actors here are decent, and Andrew and Angela in particular are actually convincing as being real humans, but they ALL say the weirdest shit. They are inhuman caricatures. Maybe that's the intent, to make us feel uneasy due to the uncanny valley, but that method does NOT work when NONE of the characters are relatable as human beings! It takes the player or viewer OUT of the story when there isn't even 1 relatable character. Andrew is almost there but still says things no normal person would say. The writing is bafflingly bad, maybe it just doesn't translate from the original language or maybe the writers are new to the scene, but it is noticeably bad script writing. Little Hope is however markedly improved from Man of Medan, which was a campy train-wreck of a script. I hope they keep improving because then by the 3rd or 4th game it will be actually scary because the characters won't just be muppets that you don't have emotions about.",Little Hope,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1XCbkoLijc,Gameplay

The thing about this game is that it tries to provide a ""Logical"" explanation to everything. Man of Medan was all hallucinations, This one is about a guy dealing with past issues, which I mean fine, it works.

Its making them the way Anthony wished they were. Its like making them better and prepared to die because they weren't ready when they actually died. This is kind of hinted from the name of the bus. The Ferryway (or something like that) is like the ferrying of the dead. That's why the bus is empty.

Usually, I really like these kind of endings - but I totally get what Seán is saying. When it's a book or a film, this is awesome because you could restart it and look for all the clues the author had sprinkled in and that you haven't seen the first time around - I love that!

I was worried it would end like Man of Medan: the scary events not really happening. One aspect I liked about Until Dawn was the supernatural stuff. I felt it added to the game and finding out the history made it even more engaging. But in this game and Medan, while they are psychological horrors, they don't end as well, in my opinion. And in this one, not only did the events not happen, most of the characters don't exist either. Also, I kind of wish that in the burning house segment in the beginning, that Andrew/Anthony wasn't given a name, and that his name during the game was Anthony. That way, you're left wondering what his name is in the 1970s version, and at the end, you see that version, present day and the bus driver are the same person with the same name. I know why they did it the way they did though.  All in all, I'm not a fan of horror but I stick around if the story is interesting. This kept me engaged until the end, that's for sure.

1500,"Part of what made Until Dawn so good was that it had one monster -- or at least one type of monster. Both Little Hope and Man of Medan had too many monsters. See, if you get to see something over and over again in various grotesque situations, you fear it more and wonder what other situations it can be in and what else it can do. If you see it over and over again, you know what it will do if and/or when it catches you, and makes you fear the end even more. If there's too many monsters, you don't get to appreciate them for what makes them terrifying -- all that fear gets spread out and undermined.

 4:38:08 Hi Jack, just to inform you a bit, the witch trials do have a significant meaning to the story. Anthony and his family lived in Little Hope in the 70's and as shown during the game, the town has rich history of the witch trials that occurred there in the 17th century. Anthony's trauma of losing his family mixed with the history of the town, thus creating the visions of his family as if they were from that time. During those witch trials, the family members of the accused were helpless and couldn't do anything: just like Anthony was helpless and unable to save his family.",Little Hope,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1XCbkoLijc,Gameplay

Honestly I really hated John and every rendition of his character. I don't know why I haven't seen anyone else express that sentiment yet. He's an annoying as hell assertive dick, plus the reminder of my own alcoholic dad and awful memories of trying to sleep with TV blasting all night long. I used to do that careful shuffle to turn it off as well, but I quickly learned he'd wake up, get mad, turn it back on again. Ok, being more careful, now he just turns it back on again. Sneaking behind couch trying not to be caught and terrified. Yet more careful and I realized the best method was to slowly turn the volume down until it was muted.
