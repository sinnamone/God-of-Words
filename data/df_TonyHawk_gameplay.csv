I remember the different mods it would have, especially the different custom boards and characters. I would always like customizing an actual skateboard to one full on colour or riding on a guitar. It was legit heaven for me as a kid, I would spend endless hours trying to make it big and achieve some sort of rank in a big clan like ""SiCK"", there was another clan, it's on the tip of my tongue but I just can't remember the name of it, they were one of the biggest clans out there on THUG2.

343,"My favorite would have to be the first one ‚òùüèΩ. It wasn‚Äôt the first of it‚Äôs kind; you had games like Grind Session and Skate or Die which were pretty fun, but Tony Hawk was by far the most assessable and because of that I continuously came back to it over the other two options. The pick up and play style of the game I appreciated but the tricks and combos allowed for so much depth... Plus the the levels were really well put together. You could tell Neversoft were passionate about skateboarding and put a lot of thought into making that game.

413,"It's so weird seeing so many people say that the THUG games are their favorites, because that's definitely where the series started going off the deep end and losing sight of what made it special to me. Maybe they're younger players? I have no disrespect for anyone that likes them, I just couldn't get into anything after THPS 4 because with THUG onward, they tried to do too much and started incorporating so much crap that took away from the game. Introducing storylines, building a whole game around Bam Margera (really?), having you control all kinds of random things that AREN'T skateboards lol. I don't know, I guess they were fun if you're into that, but that's not Tony Hawk to me. But to each their own. The first 4 games are all masterpieces though, and I hope we get some content in the future from 3 and 4 as well.
