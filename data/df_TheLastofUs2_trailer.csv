The song pretty much tells her story too. Maybe every time she plays the guitar, she hears Joel speaking to her (after all, the guitar was the last thing Ellie has left of Joel). The last bit of dialogue could have been her talking to Joel in her head and that she is telling him that she‚Äôll kill ‚Äúthem‚Äù.

132,The trailer fits the game perfectly. How would it be this intense if it was ‚Äûjust‚Äú Dina dying. I didn‚Äòt know her like I knew Joel. Ellie is shaking and obviously suffering of PTSD. Her saying ‚ÄûI will kill every last one of them‚Äú is just at the beginning of her story and showing how her character developed,The Last of Us 2,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qPNiIeKMHyg,Trailer

134,"I don‚Äôt know if this idea has been brought up before, but wouldn‚Äôt making Abby‚Äôs character some sort of relation to Marlene not make much more sense than her being the surgeon‚Äôs daughter? Like straight away it would make more sense for her to be connected to a more meaningful character from the first game. It also makes it easier for us to sympathize with her loss because whilst Joel kills the surgeon out of self defense, he actually has the choice to let Marlene go. That also adds a layer of dramatic irony to being chased down by this character since his last words to Marlene were ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll just come after her‚Äù. Last of all it could actually keep the Fireflies and Ellie‚Äôs immunity relevant and a part of the villain‚Äôs motive, not just revenge but to finish what Marlene started. They can still have their whole ‚Äúcycle of violence‚Äù theme but just more coherent with the first game imo.

142,"I'm personally pretty positive Naughty Dog had almost an entirely different idea for the story, where potentially the person who was murdered in front of Ellie was in fact Dina, and her adventure instead entailed her hunting down the people that killed her. You can tell from the way the story is played now and how it ends that with the Corona bs practically halting all progress on the story they originally were going with, they decided to last minute scrap the idea and have Joel be the one who dies instead, making Ellie's journey be to avenge him. It's pretty obvious because honestly, c'mon..they would not have made the trailer originally be her talking to Joel confronting her from behind if they hadn't planned on him becoming a companion for at least some of the game. In an effort to save time they just changed some stuff around with the story probably to shorten it enough so they could finish it on time. Still a great game in my opinion, because i can understand the kind of pressure they were under to get such a highly anticipated game finished, especially during a global pandemic.",The Last of Us 2,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qPNiIeKMHyg,Trailer

I think Abby is a misunderstood character, you knew She was seeking redemption when she goes out of her way to save Yara and Lev. The game was all about revenge, forgiveness and redemption in a post apocalyptic nightmare scenario. Both Ellie and Abby went full vengeance mode and lost everything.

169,I don't think we got a different version of the game than intended from the very beginning. What we can see in this trailer is Ellie making the promise to kill every last of them to herself but also to Joel. Joel who's already dead in this scene. This could have been a visual demonstration of what has been going on inside of Ellie after his death.  Because she was seeking revenge for his death but also for the time she didn't get but desperately needed to forgive him. And with that promise the story begins and it ends with her actually forgiving him and herself a little bit.,The Last of Us 2,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qPNiIeKMHyg,Trailer

Then, joel after her ( probably with dana and jesse. tommy too maybe, since he wouldn't have big reason to go after abby in the first place like in the game) story goes a bit like in the game until they met abby shot jesse but Doenst kill him just wounded him badly, she managed to escape.

338,"As the reason Abby kills Joel is because he killed her father who was one of the 3 surgeons who had operated on Ellie and who tried to kill her with the vaccine, I think we should add an ally of Abby more of the name of Marc who would be about the age of Ellie, and who would help her find Abby unlike the others if in the first The Last of Us, we spare Kari the surgeon who helps the 2 others who would be his mother. And if we spare him Marc would try to convince Abby to spare Joel by telling her that killing him would only bring her father back and that she could jail him, then he would defend Ellie like Owen does, and after Ellie killed Owen and Mel, Marc would be the last of their group before Abby. And he would tell Ellie that Mel was pregnant, and after being shocked by that, when she would tell him not to try to run away, throw down her gun and tell her where Abby is, he would answer her by being terrified and promising not to lie to her, run away, attack her and lead her to her telling her to calm down and begging her to spare him as Kari begs Joel if in the first The Last of Us the second surgeon is killed or shot in the leg. And since Ellie would spare him, she would ask him what he would do, and he would tell her that he was going to take Mel's body to give birth to her baby. And of course, Ellie would ask him how he will do since she is dead, but Marc would tell her that he would give birth to him by telling him that he would have to cut his stomach open with a knife, and Ellie would wish her good luck in bringing her baby into the world alive and take good care of it. On the other hand, if we kill Kari in the first The Last of Us, Marc would let Abby kill Joel to avenge his father and Marc's mother. And after Ellie kills Owen and Mel, he would talk and act like Nora when Ellie asks him where Abby is, and of course she would kill him.",The Last of Us 2,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qPNiIeKMHyg,Trailer

502,"In my opinion this game has gotten so much hate for the stupidest reason.. Sure, some things were poorly done like some story routes, but in order to make a 2nd part of The Last of Us Joel had to go. There is no other fuel strong enough to get Ellie going on a vengeance killing spree the way she did. If it was Dina in Joels place, the players (us) wouldn‚Äôt give enough of a damn to go on a vengeance story. It would‚Äôt have been the same. And also the fact that the game ends with Ellie letting Abby go, might mean there is potentially a 3rd game coming for us in the future. After the game finishes the main menu screen changes. The background being a boat on the beach and in the background the dome shaped building, described by the alleged firefly. Its a casino in real life on Catalina Island. So this hints that Abby and Lev made it to the island. My guess is that the 3rd game could be starring Abby and Lev, following the familiar role of Joel and Ellie. I dont know if that is going to be a popular idea, but i mean its an idea.  So, the game could continue that way that they find the regrouping fireflies, Abby and Lev join them, maybe Abby finds some familiar faces from long ago being a Firefly. Now Abby tells the Leader of the fireflies that Ellie is alive and the potential cure for the world because she is immune. So the 3rd game revolves about finding Ellie, with new obstacles.. maybe some Rattlers that survived wanting to find and kill Ellie for the havoc she caused in their base.. and maybe another character wanting to avenge someone who Ellie killed from the Rattlers for us to have insight on the view of the Rattlers.. but I guess thats just all an Idea.

You can simply not hate Joel and still understand to Abby he was a villain.

Ellie too slowly finds out the truth of what happened in Part 1. When they get to their destination, Fireflies try luring her into a trap to finish what they started with a cure.

But if you really want to get dragged into this emotional rollercoaster, feel for the characters and think about what's motivating them, how deep the rabbit hole goes... Then this is a perfect game. Yes, your favourite characters might die. Old ones, new ones - at any second! And you will be sad and maybe angry about it - and that's a good thing! How many games make you sad and cry?

1235,"SPOILERS...

Man did they miss the mark with this game. Especially when it comes to Joel and Ellie. :( playing as Abby isn‚Äôt even the main issue because it‚Äôs interesting to see someone else‚Äôs perspective, it‚Äôs just the way the game is executed. I see a lot of people trying to paint Ellie as becoming the villain but I just don‚Äôt see it that was because Abby also was doing shady shit. Tortured Joel, shot Jesse in the head, then Tommy. Was ready to slit Dina‚Äôs throat. Both Ellie and Abby were on a destructive path. But I just didn‚Äôt buy Ellie not killing Abby. That was my main issue with the ending.

1429,Tbh they shouldve killed dina and let joel follow ellie through revenge that way she could've developed her charackter aswell through heartbreak and learning that revenge isnt the answer and joel could've supported her in trying to convince her it wasnt and be there for her when she realizes it. Or If they really wanted to kill him off then they could've done that at the end to give a message or some shit ... like she wanted to leave after finding out about the fireflies to still get the cure done and he couldnt let her go things get messy and they have to work together and at the end she cant let him go when he is dying so she understands how he felt they could've had a heartbreaking goodbye moment at least where she realizes then to let him rest in peace and be strong for him.. ,The Last of Us 2,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qPNiIeKMHyg,Trailer
1430,"Jesus christ. This trailer is beautiful; Ellie singing while playing guitar, the blood ""tear"", the camera movement while Joel walks through the house of bloodied corpses, then seeing that windowsill from the first game :')
Too bad it's so incredibly misleading, and is playing with our emotions to get us to buy the game. I wanted to also praise Joel talking to ellie in this trailer but it seemed to robotic, like Joel wasn't even talking to her.

after finishing the game,
is that Joel in this scene is just Ellie's subconscious or smth

When I heard him, the vice president of Naught Dog, say ""I know players are gonna hate  this game"" I just got sad about the future of the industry. A future in which the priority is no longer the person who plays the game, but who creates it. I know videogames can be an art form, but they are still an entertainment medium. At this point, Nintendo is the only one who understands this, and who know how long it'll be until they also get overrun by egotistical assholes who think they can just shove player expectations up their ass.",The Last of Us 2,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qPNiIeKMHyg,Trailer
1436,"SPOILERS
Joel died, this was very obviously hinted at, never seeing his face in this trailer, him coming from the light, this trailer obviously depicts Joel as a memory.  The way he died was horrible, he deserved better, but there is no better in this world.  ‚ÄúThey replaces other characters models with joel‚Äôs‚Äù so fucking what??? They created an entire scene for the infinity war trailer that was never gonna be in the movie.  It was obvious Joel was gonna die, if you knew the world, you knew it wasn‚Äôt gonna be meaningful or glamorous.  Yes it‚Äôs shocking, but so was part I.   It was an emotional story, not just made to shock.  When Joel died, I bawled and felt Ellie‚Äôs pain.  The gaming community is one of the most toxic I‚Äôve ever encountered ‚ÄúSJW libtard PC propaganda‚Äù.  Get your heads out of your asses.  If you don‚Äôt like the story that‚Äôs fine, I personally enjoyed it, but holy fuck, don‚Äôt act like that white kid from high school that pretended to be edgy, like shut the fuck up.  The gameplay is fantastic, and I‚Äôll always love the world of the last of us.  I enjoy Ellie‚Äôs character and Dina‚Äôs character, and I understand Abby‚Äôs character.  This is a world of violence and that was what the story wanted to showcase, the horrible cycle of violence.",The Last of Us 2,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qPNiIeKMHyg,Trailer

I still think that the story is awful though, 7 years since the last game and one of the main characters (Joel) dies by a golf club because he got ambushed?

Ellie is on a path to vengeance, and she sees Joel and he is sort of a voice of reason in her mind but he's dead.
